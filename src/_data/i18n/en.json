        "question": "How long does artificial grass last in Almería's climate?",
        "answer": "Our premium artificial grass is specifically designed for Mediterranean climates and comes with UV protection. With proper installation and minimal maintenance, you can expect 15-20 years of optimal performance. All our products carry a 10-year manufacturer warranty against UV degradation and material defects."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much does artificial grass installation cost in Almería?",
        "answer": "Costs vary depending on the grass model, area size, and surface preparation needed. Our prices range from €22-32/m² for materials, with installation included. We provide free, detailed quotes with no hidden costs. Most residential gardens (50-100m²) range between €2,500-€4,500 fully installed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is artificial grass safe for pets and children?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Our artificial grass is certified non-toxic and hypoallergenic, free from lead and harmful chemicals. The advanced drainage system ensures pet urine drains quickly, and the surface is easy to clean with water. The soft fibers are gentle on children's skin, and there's no risk of mud, pesticides, or allergens common with natural grass."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does installation take?",
        "answer": "Most residential installations are completed in 1-3 days, depending on the area size and surface preparation required. A typical 50m² garden can usually be finished in a single day. We'll provide an accurate timeline during your free consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you serve the entire Almería province?",
        "answer": "Yes! We cover all of Almería province including Mojácar, Vera, Garrucha, Carboneras, Níjar, Roquetas de Mar, Aguadulce, and the capital city. We also serve international residents and holiday home owners throughout the Costa de Almería region."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance is required?",
        "answer": "Virtually none! Occasional brushing to lift the fibers and hosing to remove dust is all that's needed. Unlike natural grass, there's no mowing, watering, fertilizing, or weed control. We recommend a simple brush every few months and a rinse after dusty days. That's it."
